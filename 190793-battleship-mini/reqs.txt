Requirement 1:
The game must be implemented using HTML and JavaScript in a single file.
Assumption 1:
The game will be contained in an index.html file with embedded JavaScript code that can be parsed and tested by jsdom.

Requirement 2:
The game board must be a 6x6 grid, divided into a 3x3 top portion for AI and a 3x3 bottom portion for the human player.
Assumption 2:
The game board will be represented as an HTML table with 6 rows and 6 columns, which can be queried and verified using jsdom.

Requirement 3:
The game must have two phases: ship placement and ship sinking.
Assumption 3:
The game logic will include separate functions for the ship placement phase and the ship sinking phase, which can be unit tested.

Requirement 4:
Players must be able to place 4 different ships on their respective 3x3 grids during the placement phase.
Assumption 4:
The placement phase will allow players to click on their grid cells to position their ships, with event listeners that can be simulated and tested.

Requirement 5:
Ships must be represented as different shapes on the grid.
Assumption 5:
Each ship will occupy a unique pattern of cells on the 3x3 grid, which can be verified by checking the DOM structure.

Requirement 6:
The AI must automatically place its ships on its 3x3 grid.
Assumption 6:
An algorithm will place the AI's ships on the top 3x3 grid, which can be unit tested for correct placement.

Requirement 7:
Players must take turns attempting to sink each other's ships during the sinking phase.
Assumption 7:
The game will alternate between player and AI turns, which can be simulated and tested using Jest's timers.

Requirement 8:
The game must visually indicate hits and misses on the game board.
Assumption 8:
Hit cells will be marked with a specific class or attribute, which can be verified using jsdom queries.

Requirement 9:
The game must keep track of and display the current player's turn.
Assumption 9:
A status element will show the current turn, which can be checked using jsdom.

Requirement 10:
The game must detect and announce when all ships of a player have been sunk.
Assumption 10:
The game will update a win condition variable or display element, which can be asserted in tests.

Requirement 11:
Players must not be able to attack the same cell twice.
Assumption 11:
The game will ignore clicks on cells that have already been attacked, which can be verified through simulated clicks and DOM checks.

Requirement 12:
The game must provide a way to start a new game after one has ended.
Assumption 12:
A "New Game" button will be available, whose click event can be simulated to test game reset functionality.

Requirement 13:
The game must provide feedback on the outcome of each attack.
Assumption 13:
Messages will be displayed in a designated element, which can be checked using jsdom after simulated attacks.

Requirement 14:
The game must prevent players from placing ships outside their designated 3x3 grid.
Assumption 14:
The placement phase will include boundary checks, which can be unit tested with various input scenarios.

Requirement 15:
The game must prevent players from overlapping their ships during placement.
Assumption 15:
The placement phase will check for conflicts, which can be unit tested with different placement attempts.
