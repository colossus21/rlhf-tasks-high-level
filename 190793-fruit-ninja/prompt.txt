Create a fruit ninja inspired game in a single HTML file in which the player has to slash through shapes by clicking on those to earn points. Circles of different shapes and sizes are spawned at a random interval, the player must slash the shapes before the shapes fall below the screen. Show the score and a restart button after game is over i.e. a shape falls below the screen without getting slashed.
