Assumption 10:
The team generation process will only proceed if the number of teams input is 1 or greater.

Requirement 11:
The application must clear any previously generated teams when generating new teams.
Assumption 11:
The display area for teams will be cleared before showing newly generated teams.

Requirement 12:
The "Re-shuffle" button must only be clickable after teams have been generated.
Assumption 12:
The "Re-shuffle" button will be disabled until the first team generation is completed.

Requirement 13:
The application must maintain the same number of teams and players when re-shuffling.
Assumption 13:
The re-shuffle functionality will use the same input data as the original team generation.

Requirement 14:
