For the following requirements and assumptions pairs, please create test cases in JEST with JSDom - provide a single JS file and consider completing all tests:

Requirement 1:
The application must be implemented as a single HTML file containing JavaScript code.
Assumption 1:
The main HTML file is named index.html and contains all necessary JavaScript code within <script> tags.

Assumption 2:
There are <select> elements with options for background, face, eye, mouth, and hat types.

Each avatar component must have at least three style options.
Assumption 3:
Each dropdown menu contains a minimum of three <option> elements.

Requirement 4:
The application must allow users to change the color of each avatar component.
Assumption 4:
There are <input type="color"> elements associated with each avatar component for color selection.

Requirement 5:
The avatar must be drawn on an HTML canvas element.
Assumption 5:
There is a <canvas> element for rendering the avatar.

Requirement 6:
The avatar must update in real-time when users change any component or color.
Assumption 6:
There are event listeners attached to all dropdown menus and color inputs that trigger the avatar redraw function.

Requirement 7:
The application must include a "Randomize Avatar" button.
Assumption 7:
There is a button element with text "Randomize Avatar" and a click event listener that triggers randomization.

Requirement 8:
The "Randomize Avatar" button must generate a random combination of avatar components and colors.
Assumption 8:
The randomize function selects random options from all dropdowns and random colors for all components.

Requirement 9:

Assumption 9:
There is a button element with text "Export Image" and a click event listener that triggers image export.

Requirement 10:
The "Export Image" button must allow users to download the current avatar as an image file.
Assumption 10:
The export function converts the canvas content to a data URL and creates a download link for the image.

Requirement 11:
The application must render a complete stickman face with all selected components.
Assumption 11:
The drawing function includes separate methods for rendering each avatar component (background, face, eyes, mouth, hat).

Requirement 12:
The application must handle invalid or missing selections gracefully.
Assumption 12:
The drawing function includes default values or error handling for cases where a component is not selected.

Requirement 13:
The application must use a consistent coordinate system for placing avatar components.
Assumption 13:
All drawing functions use the same reference points (e.g., head center, body top) for positioning components.
