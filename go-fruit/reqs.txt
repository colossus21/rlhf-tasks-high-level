For the following requirements and assumptions pairs, please create test cases in JEST with JSDom - provide a single JS file and consider completing all tests, start the test name with R1, R2...etc. Make sure all tests are written and not mocked:

Requirement 1:
The game must be implemented in a single HTML file using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Assumption 1:
The game logic, styling, and structure are all contained within one index.html file.

Requirement 2:
The game must spawn circles of different sizes at random intervals.
Assumption 2:
The JavaScript code includes a function to generate circles with varying diameters at random time intervals.

Requirement 3:
The circles must appear at random positions at the top of the screen.
Assumption 3:
The spawn function generates random x-coordinates for each circle within the bounds of the game area.

Requirement 4:
The circles must fall downwards at a constant speed.
Assumption 4:
There is an animation or interval function that updates the y-position of each circle at a fixed rate.

Requirement 5:
The player must be able to slash circles by clicking on them.
Assumption 5:
An event listener is attached to each circle element to detect mouse clicks or touch events.

Requirement 6:
Slashed circles must disappear from the screen.
Assumption 6:
When a circle is clicked, its corresponding DOM element is removed from the game area.

Requirement 7:
The player must earn points for each successfully slashed circle.
Assumption 7:
A score variable is incremented each time a circle is clicked, and the score is displayed on the screen.

Requirement 8:
The game must end when a circle falls below the bottom of the screen without being slashed.
Assumption 8:
There is a check in the game loop to detect if any circle's y-position is greater than the game area's height and determine if the game should be over.

Requirement 9:
The game must display a "Game Over" message when it ends.
Assumption 9:
A game over screen or message is shown when the game end condition is met, replacing or overlaying the game area.

Requirement 10:
The final score and restart button must be displayed when the game ends.
Assumption 10:
The game over screen includes the player's final score. A button element with the text "Restart" is present on the game over screen, with an attached click event listener to reset the game state.

Requirement 11:
The game must display the current score during gameplay.
Assumption 11:
A score display element is present and updated in real-time as the player slashes circles.

Requirement 12:
The circles must have different colors.
Assumption 12:
The circle generation function assigns random colors to each circle created.
