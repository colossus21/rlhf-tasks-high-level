Create a tic-tac-toe game with a fun twist in a single HTML. Two players play this game in alternative turns - each player has 6 pieces (2 small, 2 medium, 2 large pieces of X or O). The twist is smaller piece can gobble up any pieces of the opposing team if their piece is smaller. Use drag and drop functionality of the javascript to place the pieces. Rest of the rules are same as classic tic-tac-toe.
