For the following requirements and assumptions pairs, please create test cases in JEST with JSDom - provide a single JS file and consider completing all tests, start the test name with R1, R2...etc. Make sure all tests are written and not mocked:

Requirement 1:
The game must be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Assumption 1:
The game logic and UI will be implemented in a single HTML file that includes embedded CSS and JavaScript.

The game logic will track the number of revealed cells and prevent more than two from being visible simultaneously.

Requirement 6:
The game must check for a match when two cells are revealed.
Assumption 6:
When two cells are revealed, their colors will be compared to determine if they match.

Requirement 7:
Matched pairs must remain face-up for the duration of the game.
Assumption 7:
Matched cells will have their click events disabled and remain visually distinct from unmatched cells.

Requirement 8:
Unmatched pairs must be hidden after a short delay.
Assumption 8:
If two revealed cells don't match, they will be flipped face-down after a brief timeout (e.g., 1 second).

Requirement 9:
The game must track and display the number of mistakes made by the player.
Assumption 9:
A variable will keep count of mistakes, and this count will be displayed and updated in the UI.

Requirement 10:

The game will check the mistake count after each unsuccessful match and end the game if it reaches 3.

Requirement 11:
The game must display a "Game Over" message when the player loses.
Assumption 11:
A game over message will be shown, and all cells will be revealed when the player reaches 3 mistakes.

Requirement 12:
The game must end when all pairs are successfully matched.
Assumption 12:
The game will track the number of matched pairs and end when all 8 pairs are found.

Requirement 13:
The game must display a "You Win" message when the player successfully matches all pairs.
Assumption 13:
A victory message will be shown when all 8 pairs are matched before reaching 3 mistakes.

Requirement 14:
